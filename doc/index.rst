Project Description
-------------------
The Biosim project is a the main project of the student course
INF200, lectured at the Norwegian University of Life Sciences. The project
consisted of modelling the ecosystem of the island 'Rossumøya' in python. The
ecosystem of the island contains five different landscape types and two
different animal species. The island was created according to the island
module, and the animal and landscape according to their respective modules..
The ecosystem of the island was simulated in the simulation module
which contains basic visualisation, including graphs and heat maps of
animals, and a map of the island. The simulation module also contains script
that creates a movie of the simulation.
